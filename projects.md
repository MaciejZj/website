# Projects

My personal projects are available at my GitHub.
Colaborative works can be found at my GitLab.

## EPS system in the CubeSat standard

*Developing now*

The aim of the project is to build a robust space-proof electric power
system for small aerospace devices.
Emphasizes redundant design and test driven development for embedded software.

Used technologies:

* Modern C++ in embedded devices.
* Google Test and Google Mock for unit testing.
* FreeRTOS operating system.
* CMake build system and GitLab Continuous Integration service.
* STM32 microcontroller programming with Libopencm3.
* Custom hardware design.

## Copper grains classification

*February 2020*

Classification of copper grains based on active thermography and neural
networks.
Consists in data gathering with thermal camera, data analysis, neural
network design and method evaluation.
My bachelor's degree project and topic of my thesis.

Used technologies:

* Python with PEP8 adherence.
* Jupyter notebooks.
* Scikit-image image processing library.
* Scikit-learn machine learning library.
* Tensorflow and Keras combo for deep learning.

## Project Based Learnig â€“ ATV with semi-active suspension system

*October 2019*

The project I undertook in form of individual course of studies for one
semester.
The scope of the project was to mathematically model an ATV vehicle,
identify model parameters and synthesise an adaptive digital filter for suspension
control.

The project summary and results are covered in the PM News
[magazine](https://delibra.bg.polsl.pl/dlibra/publication/55742)
(ISNN 2544-3771).

## High altitude balloon embedded software

*June 2019*

Embedded Linux software for interfacing with temperature sensor and AHRS system.
Includes data sharing system in form of local web sockets.

Used technologies:

* Modern C++ with build based on Makefiles.
* RaspberryPi hardware.
* ZMQ web socket library (more advanced MQTT competitor).
* Spdlog logger with ftm format system.
* Selected Boost libraries and C++ multithreading.

## Maze Bot

*January 2019*

My semester project for embedded systems subject.
Consist of building an obstacle avoiding robot with emphasis on control theory
algorithms for enhanced maneuver precision.
Features custom electronic, electric and mechanical design.

Used technologies:

* Atmega microcontroller.
* Arduino Bootloader.
* Custom PCB design with Autodesk Eagle.
* Custom chassis design with Autodesk Fusion 360.
* Embedded control system for DC motors velocity synchronisation and nested
  feedback loop making the robot act like a custom servomechanism.
* Modelling and identification of DC motors.

## Pi Observer

*November 2018*

Remote control and surveillance system for RaspberryPi.
Features remote GPIO access, temperature, humidity, altitude, pressure and
GPS logging.
System control and data inspection via web server, uses interactive charts, tables
and Google Maps for data visualisation.
Features live camera streaming and web preview.

Used technologies:

* Shell scripting for auto setup.
* Python for database access and hardware control.
* Full web stack and web server.
